# Rodauth Rails Demo

Example app that demonstrates how to integrate [Rodauth] authentication
framework into Rails using the [rodauth-rails] gem.

It implements the following authentication features:

* creating an account with email verification and a grace period
* login via password or email with remembering
* reset and change password
* change login with email verification
* password confirmation dialog before sensitive actions
* lockout after too many failed login attempts
* multifactor authentication (TOTP, SMS and recovery codes)
* social login via OmniAuth
* close account

It uses custom views generated by rodauth-rails. It also includes example
system tests for all authentication features.
