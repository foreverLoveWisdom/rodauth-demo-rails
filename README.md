# Rodauth Rails Demo

Example app that demonstrates how to integrate [Rodauth] authentication
framework into Rails using the [rodauth-rails] gem.

It implements authentication features such as the following:

* creating an account with email verification and a grace period
* login via password or email with remembering
* reset and change password
* change login with email verification
* password confirmation dialog before sensitive actions
* multifactor authentication (TOTP, SMS and recovery codes)
* social login with [rodauth-omniauth]
* close account

It uses custom views generated by rodauth-rails. It also includes example
system tests for all authentication features.

## Admin account

The app has an additional `/admin` section that can be accessed by a separate
admin account type. Authentication for admin accounts is defined in
`RodauthAdmin`, which inherits shared configuration from `RodauthBase`, and
adds additional behaviour:

* setting up MFA is required
* account is locked on 4th invalid login attempt
* password complexity requirements
* account creation from the console (disabled in UI)
* closed accounts are deleted from the database

Login for admin and main account types are separated, and account records are
differentiated by the `accounts.type` column.

## JSON API

The JWT feature is enabled, providing JSON API access to Rodauth endpoints
using JWT.

Here is an example JSON request for account creation, which includes the email
and the custom name parameter:

```http
POST /create-account
Content-Type: application/json

{ "login": "user@example.com", "name": "User" }
```
```http
200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJhY2NvdW50X2lkIjo2NywidW52Z...

{ "success": "An email has recently been sent to you with a link to verify your account" }
```

Here is an example JSON request for account verification, which includes the
token from the verification email link and the password for the account:

```http
POST /verify-account
Content-Type: application/json

{ "key": "81_nG-P3iYpWc3Y4-A74J821ssYHctlOhChUCPfsDh96Q4", "password": "secret" }
```
```http
200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJhY2NvdW50X2lkIjo4MiwiYXV0a...

{ "success": "Your account has been verified" }
```
